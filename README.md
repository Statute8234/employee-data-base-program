# About

This Java code is a console-based program for managing an employee database, allowing users to add, edit, and check data. It prompts users to specify the number of employees they want to manage, and offers options to add names, check the database, edit it, or add more employees. The program validates user input, providing functionalities like checking if an employee exists, editing data, and adding new employees.

# Features

It is working on a Java code that can manage an employee database using a console interface. The code can run on a console or terminal window, using standard input and output streams to communicate with the user. It can use Java classes and methods like Scanner, System, and PrintStream to read user input and print messages or data.
The code can create and maintain a database of employees using an array or list to store employee objects with attributes like name, ID, salary, or department. It can also use a file or database management system like SQLite to store and retrieve employee data.
The code can prompt the user to specify the number of employees they want to manage and offer options to add names, check the database, edit it, or add more employees. It can validate user input using methods like hasNextInt, hasNextLine, or hasNextDouble, and handle invalid input or errors using try-catch blocks or throw exceptions.
The code can perform various operations on employee data, such as adding, editing, or checking, using methods like add, set, get, or contains, and manipulating the file or database using methods like write, read, update, or delete.

# Rating

The code structure of the project is disorganized, with lengthy main methods and variable names that could be improved. The project allows users to manage an employee database by adding, editing, and checking employee records. However, there are issues with functionality, such as the editing feature not updating the database properly, lack of validation for user inputs, and inability to delete employees or perform administrative tasks.
Error handling is also minimal, with no handling for potential exceptions like InputMismatchException when reading user input with nextDouble(). The program does not handle cases where the user enters invalid input, leading to potential runtime errors.
Efficiency is normal, with the project demonstrating some understanding of Java programming concepts but still lacking robust error handling and incomplete functionality. With significant improvements in code organization, functionality, error handling, and efficiency, the project could become more useful and practical. However, it still needs substantial refinement to be considered a robust solution for managing employee data. Overall, the project demonstrates some understanding of Java programming concepts but requires significant improvements to be considered a complete and reliable solution.
